            <h3>Advanced Freight Shipping Contract Solutions</h3>

            <p>
                Parcel and freight carriers sell shipping contracts that attempt to maximize carrier profit. One of
                the most effective ways to reduce shipping costs and increase your company's profitability is to
                renegotiate and improve freight contracts. UPS contracts and FedEx freight contracts include
                numerous variables that determine the final shipping costs and profitability of each package.
            </p>

            <p>
                A small change in an accessorial charge, carrier tariff schedule, service incentive, deferred
                incentive, minimum net charge, or carrier surcharge can substantially reduce shipping costs and make
                freight contracts more favorable. The carrier contract pricing experts at Lojistic use highly
                developed analytic software and industry knowledge to benchmark and compare current FedEx contracts
                and UPS contracts versus what is available in the marketplace. Lojistic's freight contract
                negotiation and shipping audit teams will help your company improve your shipping rates and
                significantly reduce freight costs in ways other freight auditing companies cannot.
