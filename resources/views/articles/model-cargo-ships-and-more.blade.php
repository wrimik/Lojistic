                <h2>Model Cargo Ships and More!</h2>

                <p>Since the dawn of mankind's exploration of the water, ships and other watercraft have been a
                    prominent feature of daily life. They embody both the tangible economic benefits of transportation
                    and commerce and the promise and excitement of travel and discovery. Throughout history craftsmen
                    have sought to capture these qualities by making model representations of ships and boats. Model
                    ship building remains a popular and practical pastime. Consult the following information to learn
                    more about this timeless hobby.</p>

                    <h3>The History of Model Ships </h3>

                    <p>Model ships served both practical and symbolic functions in early sea-faring cultures. Ancient
                        Mediterranean people relied heavily on water transportation as a means of supporting their
                        ever-expanding empires, and their fascination with ships is well documented in the archeological
                        record. Numerous model ships called "solar boats", believed to be symbolic representations of
                        the soul's journey into the afterlife, have been unearthed in tombs across Egypt. These
                        small-scale model ships provide archeologists with an idea of what large-scale, functional ships
                        may have looked like during the time of the Pharaohs.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Model Ships </h3>

                    <p>The ancient Egyptians, on rare occasions, crafted model ships from precious metals to honor their
                        dead. Sailors often carved ship models out of walrus tusks and whale bone. Modern hobbyists
                        craft their models from a variety of materials including wood, plastic, and fiberglass. Model
                        ships crafted from folded pieces of paper provide an inexpensive and accessible toy for kids of
                        all ages.</p>

                    <h3>Uses of Model Ships </h3>

                    <p>Building full-scale ships to test new, and unproven, design innovations is both costly and
                        impractical. Model ships are often used as templates for testing large-scale designs, and in
                        simulations of situations that would be impossible to recreate in the real-world. The cargo and
                        container ship industry relies on laboratory simulations to improve the safety and effectiveness
                        of their ship's designs. In an activity known as "wargaming", military strategists and
                        historians use model ships to recreate important battles.</p>

                    <h3>Model Ship Museums and Other Resources </h3>

                    <p>There are a variety of resources available to both curious beginners and seasoned model-building
                        veterans alike. Both the Smithsonian and the U.S. Naval Academy Museum feature model ships as
                        part of their permanent exhibits, and many smaller maritime museums display models that portray
                        ships that have a specific regional significance. Organizations dedicated to preserving historic
                        ships, like the Historic Naval Ships Association, serve as valuable starting points for model
                        builders who want to accurately recreate a specific type of ship. The Nautical Research Guild
                        provides a comprehensive list of resources covering a variety of model ship building
                        subjects.</p>
