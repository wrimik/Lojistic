                <h2>10 Ways To Help Save The Oceans by Lojistic</h2>
                <p>
                    It is easy to forget about keeping our oceans clean. They are such large,
                    vast bodies of water that it seems incredible that a single plastic bottle
                    could really affect its biodiversity. In truth, when everyone thinks this
                    way, it really does add up. Apart from trash, our oceans suffer in many other
                    ways too. Pollution from toxic chemicals, fertilizers, petroleum, and other
                    substances harms life in the ocean. Since we are all connected and dependent
                    on the ocean as a food source, as well as an important element of climate,
                    it is in our best interest to keep the water clean. Read on for some tips on
                    how to get started!
                </p>
                <h3>Reduce Carbon Footprints</h3>
                <p>
                    When we use fossil fuels for electricity and energy, it creates extra carbon
                    dioxide in the atmosphere. When this extra carbon dioxide is absorbed into oceans,
                    it makes the water more acidic. In turn, the higher acidity levels negatively
                    affect ocean creatures and plants. By paying attention to our energy use and
                    lowering it, we can contribute towards a mass effort in maintaining a lower acidity
                    level in the waters.

                <h3>Consume Sustainable Seafood Products</h3>
                <p>
                    Governments have set fishing laws in place in order to help control fishing
                    practices and allow ocean life to continue to thrive naturally. When companies
                    disregard these laws and overfish, marine populations are depleted faster than
                    they can recover. We can play our part in discouraging these practices by only
                    buying from companies that use sustainable fishing practices. Always read the
                    labels to check for sustainability information.

                <h3>Use Less Plastic</h3>
                <p>
                    Plastic can eventually wind up in the ocean in many ways, even if beach-goers
                    do not directly dump it there. Items like plastic bottles, bags, and soda can
                    plastic rings can suffocate or entangle marine creatures. Thousands of them die
                    this way each year. Limit your plastic usage by opting for reusable items instead.
                    When using plastic, make sure to recycle it properly.

                <h3>Use Smart Gardening Techniques</h3>
                <p>Many chemical products, such as pesticides and herbicides, that are commonly
                    used by gardeners are washed away into the soil and drains. These chemicals
                    eventually drain into the ocean and pollute the water. To help avoid this,
                    use natural products instead, or at least limit the use of chemicals. The same
                    principle applies to other substances, such as car washing soaps and waxes.

                <h3>Buy Ocean Friendly Goods</h3>
                <p>Some companies are quite reckless in how they procure raw materials to manufacture
                    their products. For example, they may take pieces of coral reefs or tortoise shells.
                    This hurts the natural marine environment since these types of things slowly grow
                    over many years or even decades. To make a difference, shop at stores that use
                    ocean-friendly practices.

                <h3>Don&rsquo;t Litter at the Beach</h3>
                <p>Reducing litter at the beach is one of the biggest ways to lower the impact of
                    ocean pollution. Take a garbage bag along to collect litter produced during your
                    trip. Afterwards, deposit it in a trashcan, or take it home to dispose of it
                    there. To make an even bigger difference, join or organize a beach clean-up mission.

                <h3>Educate Yourself </h3>
                <p>One of the best ways to know how to save the oceans is to learn more about it.
                    Read up on the different ways in which they are being harmed, and then research
                    ways to reduce the impact. Educating ourselves about these issues goes much further
                    than only learning about the ocean. Find out about how the ocean and its marine life
                    are connected to all of us and our economy. Teach your friends and family too, so that
                    everyone can be more aware.
                </p>

                <h3>Boat and Fish Responsibly</h3>
                <p>
                    A good deal of ocean pollution comes from boaters and fishers who dump trash and
                    chemical products into the water. When fishing, obey the local fishing laws and
                    never fish above the legal limits. Be respectful of natural habitats; collect
                    any trash in a bag and dispose of it properly upon returning back to shore. Boaters
                    should maintain their boats regularly to avoid accidental spills of fuels or other
                    hazardous materials.

                <h3>Support Ocean Protection Organizations</h3>
                <p>Not all of us can join a marine conservation team out in the field, but we can
                    help out in other ways. Donating to charity and research organizations is a big
                    way to encourage their work. Alternatively, join a short term project, put up
                    posters, or ask if there are other ways to volunteer. Organizations often require
                    other types of help apart from scientists or cleanup crews. For example, they may
                    need administrative or promotional volunteers too.

                <h3>Spread the Word to Others</h3>
                <p>
                    Telling others about ocean conservation efforts is a wonderful way to make others
                    get involved. Bring a guest speaker to your child&rsquo;s school or organize a
                    field trip for kids. Even by simply talking to people on an individual basis, we
                    can help to get the word out. Always encourage others to spread the word too!
