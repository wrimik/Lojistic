                <h2>Freight Audit Services: Learning About Standard Carrier Alpha Codes</h2>

                <p>The transportation industry devised the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) system to help identify
                    competing companies. Each SCAC identification code ranges between 2 and 4 alphabetical characters
                    long. During the 1960s, The National Motor Freight Traffic Association developed the SCAC system in
                    order to help convert their paper-based documents into computerized records. Freight carriers must
                    use the SCAC system when filing tariffs with the Surface Transportation Board. The United States
                    Department of Customs and Border Protection uses the SCAC system to identify ocean carriers and
                    freight forwarders in their own unique Automated Manifest System, which produces and transmits
                    electronic customs documents and manifests in accordance to the “24 Hours Rule.” In addition, the
                    United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employs SCAC identification code for tracking
                    imported food. All freight carriers conducting business with the United States government must use
                    the SCAC system, even if the freight comes from the private sector.</p>

                <p>In the United States, the transportation industry uses the SCAC system to identify freight carriers
                    with intricate computer systems. More specifically, the petroleum, forest products, transportation
                    suppliers, and automobile industries use the SCAC system to identify freight carriers listed in
                    shipping documents, such as the Purchase Order, Bill of Lading, Packing List, and the Freight Bill.
                    Each of these commercial documents identifies the type, quantity, and price agreement between the
                    buyer and seller. The freight carrier uses these shipping documents to transport the materials to
                    its recorded destination. Other organizations use the SCAC system for the same purposes, such as the
                    United Nations EDIFACT, the Accredited Standards Committee X12, and the American National Standards
                    Institute.

                <ul class="ul">
                <li>Freight carriers refer to bill of ladings as a detailed source of information about the shipment of
                    merchandise. It also assigns a title of that particular shipment to its designated party.
                </li>
                <li>Freight carriers usually include a packing list, an itemized document that specifies the type,
                    quantity, description, and weight of the contents in a specific package.
                </li>
                <li>Freight carriers refer to purchase orders, commercial documents provided by the buyer to a seller,
                    for a thorough understanding of the types, quantities, and established prices of the contents
                    contained within the shipment.
                </li>
                <li>In general, freight carriers who comply with the standards outlined in the Uniform Intermodal
                    Interchange Agreement (UIIA) must maintain their SCAC to the highest acceptable level. The
                    transportation industry reserves certain types of SCACs for specific purposes. For instance, freight
                    cas mark their freight containers with an SCAC identification tag ending with the letter “U.”
                    Railroad freight carriers mark privately owned railroad cars with the SCAC identification tag ending
                    with the letter “X.” The trucking industry marks their truck chassis and trailers, often used in
                    intermodal service, with the SCAC rrieridentification tag ending with the letter “Z.”
                </li>
                <li>The Uniform Intermodal Interchange Agreement (UIIA) promotes intermodal efficiencies through the
                    uniformity of the transportation industry, which governs the interchange of intermodal equipment.
                </li>
                <li>The transportation industry assigns specific SCAC codes for different purposes.</li>
                <li>Freight carriers can obtain SCAC codes by contacting the National Motor Freight Traffic
                    Association.
