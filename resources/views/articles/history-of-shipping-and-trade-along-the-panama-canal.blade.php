            <h2>History of Shipping and Trade Along the Panama Canal</h2>
            <p>The Panama Canal is probably the most popular and captivating tourist attraction
                of Panama that significantly accelerated and improved trading among several nations
                around the world. It is a waterway across the
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus" target="_blank">Isthmus</a> of
                Panama used by ships to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.
                The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/canal" target="_blank">canal</a>
                is around 50 miles (80.47 km) long and extends from the Limon Bay of Colon on the
                Atlantic side to Balboa&rsquo;s Panama Bay on the Pacific side.

                are installed at the Atlantic and Pacific ends to either raise ships to the canal or
                lower them to sea level. The construction of the canal cost the lives of thousands of
                people who died mostly from diseases such as malaria and yellow fever. The Americans
                completed the canal in 1914 and saved voyagers around 8,000 nautical miles (12,875 km)
                of journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean that originally required ships to go
                around Cape Horn in South America&rsquo;s southern tip. Navigating the waters of Cape Horn
                is hazardous due to large waves and strong winds in the area.

            <p>The king of Spain, Charles I who was also the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V hatched the
                idea of building the Panama Canal in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. In 1534, he ordered a
                study of a route through Panama that will hugely cut the travel time between Spain and
                Peru to enhance the economic growth of Spain. Charles V also realized that the Panama
                Canal could bring Spain a tactical advantage over the military forces of Portugal.
                The bid of Spain to start the canal project was completely abandoned when wars in
                Europe started during that time. It was the turn of the French government to
                attempt building the Panama Canal in 1882. France, however, gave up the project
                due to lack of funds and after suffering plagues from diseases that caused the
                loss of lives of about 20,000 people working on the construction of the canal.
                Its haphazard approach to digging the canal also led to costly and disastrous landslides.

            <p>The interest of the U.S. on the Panama Canal was motivated by the gold rush in California
                in 1848. This was further heightened by the desire of the U.S. to have a powerful naval
                force that will dominate the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. U.S. President
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/theodoreroosevelt" target="_blank">Theodore Roosevelt</a>
                promised in 1901 to work on the Panama Canal project. The U.S. made endeavored to get
                the nod of the Colombian government to build the Panama Canal through a
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.treatylaw.org/whatisatreaty.asp" target="_blank">treaty</a>.
                All efforts failed leading President Roosevelt to resort to an unusual strategy and get
                the green light for the canal project. He wooed the rebels supporting the independence
                movement of Panama from Colombia by promising them military assistance in return for U.S.
                rights to develop the Panama Canal. President Roosevelt’s initiative paid-off and the
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0312134/palindromes.html" target="_blank">palindrome</a>
                “A man, a plan, a canal: Panama” was coined for him to be remembered for his contribution to
                giving the U.S. rights to build the Panama Canal. The newly-formed government of Panama
                immediate went into negotiations with the U.S. for the development of the Panama Canal
                through Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French businessman. A treaty known as the Hay-Bunau-Varilla
                Treaty was ratified by both countries in 1904 that gave the U.S. exclusive and perpetual
                rights to the canal of the Isthmus of Panama. The republic of Panama, in return, received an
                outright compensation of US$10 million and will receive after nine years the amount of
                US$250,000 per year. The U.S. is also obliged by the treaty to protect the independence of
                Panama. In the 1960s, tension developed as Panamanians started to question the treaty that
                granted the U.S. the right to establish a territory called the Canal Zone in Panama. The
                Panamanians also complained of discrimination in the zone by the U.S. This led to riots
                against the Americans. Consequently, U.S. President
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/jimmycarter" target="_blank">Jimmy Carter</a>
                and Panama&rsquo;s <em>de facto</em> leader
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/ajb/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Omar_Torrijos.html" target="_blank">Omar Torrijos</a>
                signed in 1977 the Torrijos-Carter Treaties to end the tensions. One of the treaties is
                called the Panama Canal Treaty which calls for the turnover of the Canal Zone to Panama
                noontime (Panama local time) of December 31, 1999. This was done and on January 1, 2000, the
                <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pancanal.com/eng/acp/acp-overview.html" target="_blank">Panama Canal Authority (ACP)</a>
                took over the management of the Panama Canal. The other treaty called the Treaty Concerning
                the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal or the Neutrality Treaty gave the
                U.S. the permanent right to defend the canal from any harm. The 1977 treaties led to the status
                of the Panama Canal as an international waterway. As a neutral facility, every vessel is
                guaranteed safe passage even during war.

            <p>Modern shipping has progressed so much since the Panama Canal started operating almost a
                century ago. Ships have increased in size and tonnage that exceed the capacity that the
                Panama Canal can handle - the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6642"target="_blank">Panamax</a>.
                ACP must continue to find ways to make the Panama Canal indispensible amid the
                existence of other sites where a new canal can be built to address the changing
                configuration of ships. Thousands of Panamanians will lose their jobs if the canal fails
                to expand and meet the requirements of the maritime industry. Panama&rsquo;s economy will
                eventually be adversely affected. Panama has addressed this concern with an ‘expansion project
                on the Panama Canal that started in 2007 and expected to be completed in 2014. The expansion
                will double the size of the ship that the Panama Canal can handle, thus, increasing the volume
                of goods that will be transported through the canal.
