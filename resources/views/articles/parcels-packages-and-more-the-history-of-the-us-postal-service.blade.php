                <h2>Parcels, Packages and More! <br/> The History of the U.S. Postal Service</h2>  <p>In the United States, hundreds of millions of pieces of mail are sent every single day. Often taken for granted, this impressive system of mailing by the U.S. Postal Service is an integral part of communication and delivery. The U.S. Postal Service's importance has grown throughout its history, and the way mail has been delivered over the years has evolved since its conception in the late 18th century. The postal services place in the future is still being discussed today.</p>  <p>Initially in 1775, Benjamin Franklin was elected the first Postmaster General under the Continental Congress, and he is often given credit as being the first Postmaster General. He had worked in the postal service while America was still a colony under British rule, and made significant contributions. However, under the Constitution, the first Postmaster General was a man by the name of Samuel Osgood. The U.S. government began to tweak the system carefully, to make mailing letters, parcels, and packages much more efficient. Initially, when letters were sent, the receiver paid the cost of the letter, not the sender. However this proved to only increase the likelihood of mail being refused; therefore, couriers would be expending effort without receiving compensation for delivery. So the postal service developed stamps in the mid-1800's to provide a more efficient service as well as create a standard for delivery costs.</p>  <p> The Pony Express came into play in the latter mid-1800's as a way to provide a quick overland passage to California. Before the Pony Express, parcels had to be shipped to Panama, carried over land a little ways, and then shipped again. The Pony Express cut straight through the United States and over the Rocky Mountains. Thankfully for the horses, mail was soon being delivered by trains and then automobiles in early 1900's. Then to make deliveries speedier, planes began to deliver parcels and packages. The postal service was constantly trying to create postal routes to rural areas and to make delivering mail more and more efficient. </p>  <p>Mail was beginning to be streamlined internationally, and began reducing residential delivery times. However, due to the efficiency of the postal service, there was a tremendous increase in mail volume, and the postal service began to implement a number system to help with delivery called the Zoning Improvement Plan, or the ZIP Code. This helped sort mail and make deliveries more efficient. Technology also helped improved the postal service's efficiency by streamlining sorting and delivering methods.</p>  <p>In 1970, the Postal Reorganization Act made the, what was called the United States Post Office Department, become the United States Postal Service. The U.S. Postal Service was an independent agent of the government which meant that the postal service was run more like a business than a government agent. Today, the U.S. Postal Service is still the largest postal service in the United States despite other privatized companies.</p>
