                <h2>History of Freight Transportation</h2>
                <p>Throughout the centuries there have been many modes of freight transportation. For many
                    years, goods traveled to their destinations by way of horse drawn wagons. This mode of
                    moving freight was slow and often dangerous. Later, with the introduction of the railway
                    system, business owners could send goods across the country in a faster, safer way. Goods
                    traveled to various cities via steamboat and, later, cargo ships delivered goods to foreign
                    countries. The invention of airplanes created another option for transporting freight to
                    faraway destinations. Business owners have always looked for better, faster, more secure
                    ways to ship their goods. The following looks at the steady progress in the history of
                    freight transportation.

                <h3>Transporting Freight by Ship</h3>
                <p>
                    Before the introduction of the steamboat in the early nineteenth century, many
                    types of goods were moved by flatboat or raft. It was risky to move freight
                    by these basic modes of transportation as well as time-consuming. In addition,
                    flatboats, rafts, and similar watercraft had to be paddled by crew members.
                    Steamboats transported goods in a faster, more efficient way. Today, we have
                    cargo ships that are able to transport heavy machinery, pipes, huge rolls of wire,
                    and even foods packed into special refrigerated compartments. In addition,
                    there are containerships that carry cargo in large containers that can be
                    moved easily on and off a ship. These containers may house foods, electronics
                    or textiles along with a variety of other commercial goods.

                <h3>Transporting Freight by Train</h3>

                <p>A railroad line connecting the western part of America with the eastern part was
                    in the minds of visionaries for years. A railroad line that traveled across the
                    entire country could transport a variety of commercial goods as well as passengers.
                    This idea came to life in the form of the Transcontinental Railroad. In 1869, the
                    tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad joined together
                    to create the Transcontinental Railroad. Business owners who transported their goods
                    across country by the Transcontinental Railroad system knew that their valuables would
                    be secure and arrive at their destination in a timely fashion. They no longer had to
                    depend on slow horse drawn wagons that were vulnerable to poor road conditions and other
                    mishaps. Business owners had a better, more reliable way to deliver their goods! Today,
                    freight trains can deliver large quantities of goods across the country. Some freight
                    trains are made to transport raw materials such as coal and other types of minerals.
                    Other freight trains carry goods that need to be refrigerated such as vegetables or
                    various dairy products. One of the biggest advantages of transporting goods by train is
                    that this mode of transportation doesn&rsquo;t have to compete with cars or trucks on
                    the road. It has its own set path all the way through to its destination!

                <h3>Freight Transportation by Truck</h3>

                <p>Many types of goods travel back and forth across America by truck. Clothing,
                    food, cars, tools, and heavy machinery are just a few examples of the commercial
                    goods transported by trucks. During the 1930s, business owners began to deliver
                    their goods by truck. At that time, automobiles were becoming popular and, as
                    a consequence, the roads were being paved over and improved. The introduction
                    of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century allowed the
                    trucking industry to experience tremendous growth. Today, trucks are responsible
                    for a large percentage of the commercial shipping activity that occurs in the United States.

                <h3>Freight Transportation by Airplane</h3>

                <p>The invention of the airplane in the early twentieth century brought forth
                    another option in the realm of freight transportation. Over the years,
                    improvements were made to early airplanes that eventually lead to the development
                    of the jet. Jets and airplanes became a reliable way to transport commercial
                    goods (cargo) such as furniture, cars, and certain types of machinery. Sometimes
                    large animals such as horses are transported via airplane. Today, there are some
                    airlines that provide overnight delivery of packages and letters. Delivering freight
                    by airplane is fast and efficient though sometimes dangerous weather conditions can
                    delay or cancel a flight. Some business owners who want their goods transported in
                    the fastest way possible opt for delivery by air.
