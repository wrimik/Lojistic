                <h2>Recycling Resources for Freight Packaging & More</h2>

                <p>Every day, millions of people around the world throw out tons of trash that goes to landfills. They
                    decay there and add to pollution in the environment. This also harms living creatures on the planet
                    (including us!). However, many of the things that people discard in wastebaskets can actually be
                    recycled. Some of these items include newspaper, glass bottles, aluminum cans, and plastic bags.
                    Apart from recycling, it is also important to know which items go in each of the different recycling
                    bins, so that they can be recycled correctly. We can learn about recycling by reading about it or
                    watching educational videos. There are also many other fun ways to find out more about this subject.
                    For example, kids can try out science experiments or projects, play an online game, or test their
                    knowledge with a quiz. Explore the collection of resources in this article to learn more about
                    recycling. Remember to share your knowledge with friends and family members too so that everyone can
                    get involved!</p>
