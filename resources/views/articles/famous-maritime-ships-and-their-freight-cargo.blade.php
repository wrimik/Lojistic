                <h2>Famous Maritime Ships and Their Freight Cargo</h2>

                <p>Boats of all sizes serve the essential purpose of providing
                    passage for individuals and cargo across bodies of water. While
                    some boats are small and meant to be recreational, others have
                    served a greater purpose and have played a significant role in
                    history. Circumstantial evidence dates the history of the boat
                    back to over 40,000 years ago though the oldest boat to be discovered
                    is from approximately 10,000 years ago. Additional information on
                    some of the most famous boats in history is found below.
