                <h2>From Land To Sea; Types of Cargo</h2>

                <p>In the private sector, small businesses and corporations need to have their goods transported in bulk
                    to a distribution center. Any designated shipment uses one of several transportation mediums,
                    including marine, air, train, and road carriers. Freight carriers may use numerous transportation
                    vessels, including container ships, airplanes, box cars, and tractor trailers to deliver cargo to
                    its assigned port. Commercial establishments refer to these goods as cargo, or freight, and consider
                    these packaged items as high-value assets. Each shipment may be transported through the air or
                    water. The exchange of cargo between carriers occurs at terminals, wherein handlers prepare the next
                    shipment for delivery to its corresponding distribution center.</p>

                <h3>Heavy Equipment and Machinery</h3>

                <p>Industrial cargo usually includes household machinery, technical machinery, automobiles, auxiliary
                    machinery, and engineering machinery. Handlers move heavy equipment and machinery onto wooden
                    crates, or conceal them in heavy-duty steel containers. Handlers must follow strict instructions
                    given to them by the client. In addition, seaport and airport terminals must investigate each
                    package to ensure that it has not incurred damage during transit. Carriers and handlers must also
                    follow regulations imposed onto them by federal, state, and local agencies.

                    <h3>Dangerous or Hazardous Cargo</h3>

                    <p>Carriers and handlers must pay close attention to freight that contains hazardous or dangerous
                        materials. Freight that contains these hazardous materials must undergo rigorous inspection, and
                        typically requires the carriers andhandlers to follow strict safety protocol. In some instances,
                        carriers and handlers may need to wear safety equipment to ensure that it does not pose severe
                        harm to them on human contact. Carriers and handlers constitute hazardous materials as harsh
                        chemicals, oil, asbestos, petrol, diesel, and other undisclosed agents. Carriers and handlers
                        must exercise extreme caution when transporting these items to avoid accidents and potential
                        fatalities.</p>

                    <br/>

                    <h3>Inflammable or Combustible Cargo</h3>

                    <p>Carriers and handlers may also come in contact with inflammable and combustible cargo. Freight
                        that contains inflammable and combustible cargo must undergo rigorous inspection, and usually
                        entails the strict adherence to safety protocol. Inflammable and combustible cargomay
                        spontaneously ignite due to the nature of the caustic materials contained within the freight. In
                        addition, each freight container can easily catch on fire, thus posing the risk of setting the
                        entire shipment ablaze. Carriers and handlers must wear safety equipment when handling this type
                        of cargo as it may pose a risk of serious injury and fatality. Inflammable and combustible cargo
                        may include goods, such as oil seeds, diesel, cotton, oil, and jute.</p>

                    <h3>Concentrates or Ores </h3>

                    <p>Carriers and handlers receive orders to prepare and deliver cargo containers with concentrates or
                        ores within them. This type of freight is extremely dense. In addition, freight containing
                        concentrates may emit toxic fumes, which can deplete oxygen inside of the tank. Therefore,
                        handlers and carriers must exercise caution and wear respirators when handling concentrates and
                        ores. Carriers and handlers must enact preventative measures to ensure that the concentrates and
                        ores do not absorb excessive moisture.</p>

                    <h3>Bulk Cargo </h3>

                    <p>Carriers and handlers prepare and deliver scrap metal, grains, gypsum, logs, salt, aluminum, wood
                        chips, and sand in bulk. Freight containing these items requires special handling to ensure that
                        the shipment does not become ruined by the elements. Some of these items will need extra
                        protection from moisture exposure. As with other shipments, carriers and handlers should
                        exercise safety precautions when preparing bulk items, especially heavy metals with sharp and
                        rigged edges. Most transportation and distribution centers administer theirown safety protocol
                        in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations.</p>

                    <h3>Food Products </h3>

                    <p>Carriers and handlers receive shipments that contain perishable and non-perishable foods, such as
                        grains, fresh produce, jellies, jams, pickles, syrups, canned vegetables, tinned fruit, frozen
                        fruits and vegetables, sea food, frozen meat, and beer. Carriers and handlers who prepare and
                        deliver food products must ensure that the transportation vessel has a refrigerated storage unit
                        for perishable items. The temperature and moisture levels of the refrigerated storage unit must
                        adhere to federal, state, and local regulations. In addition, the food products stored within
                        the refrigerated unit must not exceed its maximum capacity. Carriers and handlers who follow
                        these regulatory standards will minimize any potential loss.</p>

                    <h3>Military Equipment and Project Cargo </h3>

                    <p>The military often issues special deliveries of large equipment that cannot be fit into any
                        containers, such as windmills, air conditioners, generators, and defense weapons. Carriers and
                        handlers who prepare and deliver these items should follow the orders given by the military
                        personnel administering the shipment. Due to the size of these items, carriers and handlers
                        should restrain the equipment with the proper tools and materials. In addition, carriers and
                        handlers should wear the proper safety equipment to prevent potential injuries</p>

                    <h3>Leather Hides and Textiles </h3>

                    <p>Carriers and handlers may have to prepare and deliver leather hides to clothing, apparel, and
                        related manufacturers. Freight containing products made from leather hides often produce strong
                        odors. This requires the transportation carrier to keep the freight in isolation, especially
                        when handlers have prepared the leather hides with salt. Carriers and handlers should wear
                        respirators when handling leather hides as they tend to emit noxious fumes.</p>

                    <br/>

                    <h3>Fragile Items </h3>

                    <p>Every freight shipment requires transportation carriers to handle the shipment with care;
                        however, some cargo contains fragile items that require extra caution. Fragile items may include
                        items, such as clay figurines, glassware, chinaware, small machinery, tools, furniture, lamps,
                        computers, televisions, and electronic gadgets. Handlers must package these items with extreme
                        care. In addition, the transportation vessel should have added protection to prevent incurring
                        damage. Carriers and handlers should wear safety equipment in the event these items shatter,
                        tear, burst, or otherwise become ruined.</p>
