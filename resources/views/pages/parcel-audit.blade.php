                    Implementing a parcel audit will help reduce your transportation costs and give you better insight
                    into your overall transportation operations. A parcel audit works by deep scanning your shipping
                    invoices and identifying errors. Our parcel audit team then reaches back out to the carriers and
                    secure credits on your behalf. With a <a href="/parcel-audit/fedex-audit">FedEx audit</a>, your credits will be reflected on the audited
                    invoice. But with a <a href="/parcel-audit/ups-audit">UPS audit</a>, your credits will post on a future invoice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A parcel audit will normally procure savings in the amount of 1-7% of net transportation spend.
                    Parcel audit implementation is quick and easy, you can be saving money almost instantly. The
                    onboarding procedures are slightly different for a FedEx audit versus a UPS audit, but you can rest
                    easy as both processes are very simple.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once your parcel audit has been started, youâ€™ll start seeing savings almost immediately. As
                    previously mentioned, with a FedEx audit you will see credits applied to the audited invoice. A UPS
                    audit secures credits that are applied against future invoices. No matter your carrier, a shipping
                    audit will help put money back in your pocket and has the power to identify other saving
                    opportunities in your transportation operations.
                </p>
