                <p>
                    Every UPS and FedEx shipper has the right to ensure their shipping bills are accurate and that all
                    service guarantees have been fulfilled. Both UPS and FedEx are very familiar with Lojistic acting as
                    a third-party freight parcel audit company. Freight bill auditing is absolutely necessary in the
                    freight management industry and is a widely accepted practice by UPS and FedEx.

                    Lojistic's UPS auditing and FedEx auditing services will be set-up so that our team of freight
                    auditors receives your company's electronic invoice automatically. Set-up varies slightly with each
                    small parcel carrier; however, it is a very simple process with both carriers and can be
                    accomplished in minutes. At Lojistic we design our freight audit services to be as efficient as
                    possible for all parties involved.

                <p>
                    The results of our freight auditing services are very transparent. UPS and FedEx refunds generated
                    by our freight auditors are applied directly to your shipping account. We provide a weekly report
                    detailing all carrier credits that have resulted from our transportation parcel audit.

                <p>
                    <a rel="nofollow" href="/parcel-audit/ups-audit">UPS audits</a> are usually conducted on a post-audit basis. Each weekly UPS invoice is thoroughly
                    audited for carrier service failures and billing mistakes. All refund credits generated by
                    Lojistic's freight audit services will appear on a future UPS invoice, thus reducing shipping costs.
                    FedEx audits are typically conducted on a pre-audit basis.

                <p>
                    One of our professional freight auditors will perform an extensive review of each FedEx invoice
                    before your accounting team remits payment each week. We will ensure FedEx applies the appropriate
                    refund credits directly to your shipping account, and provide your accounts payable team with a
                    revised FedEx invoice. Our FedEx parcel freight audit service will successfully reduce freight costs
                    every week and ensure that shipping contracts are optimized to benefit your company in both the
                    short and long-term.

                    invoices?</h2>

                <p>
                    Several of the most common FedEx and UPS billing errors are due to late deliveries, erroneous
                    address correction charges, erroneous residential delivery charges, packages manifested but not
                    shipped, erroneous dimensional weight charges, duplicate charges, erroneous delivery area
                    surcharges, and packages with no proof of delivery.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are numerous carrier service failures and billing mistakes that occur on virtually every
                    invoice. It is an essential part of risk management to monitor each package and every charge that
                    appears on your carrier invoices. Our software and team of professional parcel freight auditors
                    conduct a 46-point audit of each individual shipment that appears on your carrier invoice. We do
                    this in both our UPS audits and FedEx audits. Each audit point is a potential source of UPS and
                    FedEx billing errors and thus a potential source of carrier refund credits.</p>

                <h2>Will my UPS and FedEx relationship be adversely affected when I hire Lojistic to audit my FedEx and

                <p>
                    Your UPS and FedEx relationship will not be adversely affected by our parcel freight audit services.
                    One of the most effective ways to get your small parcel carrier to improve their level of service is
                    to remind them they are not the only carrier. UPS and FedEx need to work to retain your business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A critical part of superior parcel and freight carrier service is accurately billing for services
                    rendered. Our UPS auditing and FedEx auditing services ensure that every charge on your bill is
                    accurate. As a result of our services, many of our parcel freight auditing customers actually
                    receive a higher level of service from their carrier. UPS audits and FedEx audits are an accepted
                    practice in the industry and are a great way to help maximize efficiency and lower costs.

                    Yes. Lojistic's freight audit will reduce freight costs on each FedEx and UPS invoice, as well as
                    allow your accounting department to pay each carrier invoice by credit card. UPS auditing and FedEx
                    auditing through Lojistic is cost-effective and convenient at the same time.
