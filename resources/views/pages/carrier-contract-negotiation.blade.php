                <h2>Freight and Small Parcel Shipping Contract Negotiation &amp; Analysis</h2>

                <p>The most effective way to reduce freight shipping costs is to negotiate your
                    current small parcel and freight contracts in an effort to achieve lower
                    rates from FedEx, UPS, and other carriers. It is common knowledge that the
                    carriers sell freight shipping contracts that maximize carrier profit. UPS
                    contracts and FedEx contracts include numerous variables that determine the
                    final small parcel freight shipping costs of a package. A small change in an
                    accessorial charge, carrier tariff schedule, service incentive, deferred incentive,
                    minimum net charge, or carrier surcharge can substantially reduce shipping
                    costs associated with freight contracts. The carrier and shipment contract
                    pricing experts at Lojistic use highly developed analytic software
                    and industry knowledge to analyze current FedEx contracts and UPS contracts
                    in order to identify opportunities to lower shipping costs for you. Lojistic's
                    freight contract negotiation team will help your company modify
                    current freight contracts, resulting in reduced freight costs.</p>

                <p>Lojistic employs the carrier pricing expertise of former UPS, FedEx,
                    and freight carrier employees with innovative small parcel and freight
                    shipping rate analytic technology to maximize freight cost savings. Due to
                    our extensive knowledge and understanding of the industry's complex pricing
                    environment (both domestic shipping rates and international shipping rates),
                    we are able to effectively analyze carrier proposals, which helps result in
                    reduced shipping costs for our clients. Simply put, we know how to reduce
                    shipping costs.</p>

                <h3>What Lojistic Will Do To Reduce Shipping Costs:</h3>

                <p>Our carrier pricing experts will perform an analysis of current shipping
                    contracts to determine small parcel and freight cost reduction opportunities.
                    Lojistic's carrier pricing analytics, freight pricing knowledge,
                    carrier negotiation expertise, and shipping industry experience enable our
                    team to precisely identify areas of opportunity to improve your existing
                    freight and small parcel contracts for the lowest FedEx and UPS negotiated
                    rates. We will develop a customized strategy to optimize your shipment
                    contract incentives and structure. Lojistic will manage the UPS
                    contract and FedEx contract negotiation process on your company's behalf.
                    On average, our customers experience a 12% small parcel freight cost
                    reduction after our carrier pricing and negotiation team executes the
                    following steps to lower shipping costs:</p>

                <h3>Why Lojistic?</h3>

                <p>
                    Lojistic employs the freight bill audit resources of highly
                    experienced former UPS, FedEx and DHL employees with innovative logistics
                    audit technology to deliver maximum freight cost savings. Of all freight
                    audit companies we believe our freight auditing solutions are most effective
                    in reducing shipping costs. Companies that try to do so on their own do not
                    always figure out how to reduce shipping costs. As your UPS auditor and FedEx
                    auditor, Lojistic will guarantee freight cost reduction when you
                    make use of our freight audit services. Our fees are performance-based,
                    meaning our compensation is a contingent share of actual freight cost savings
                    produced by our freight bill audit services for your shipment contract
                    agreements and freight contracts. Employing the logistics audit technology
                    and carrier audit pricing expertise of Lojistic will dramatically
                    reduce your shipping costs and increase operational efficiencies. Lojistic
                    knows how to reduce shipping costs significantly.
