                <p>
                    We have many satisfied customers who can attest to the fact that our shipping contract negotiation
                    services have reduced UPS and FedEx costs. Though it is common for carrier account executives to
                    attempt to dissuade you from procuring freight contract negotiation help with your UPS contract
                    negotiations and FedEx contract negotiations, third party shipping consultants are a standard part
                    of the industry. Lojistic can help you negotiate good shipping contracts and answer any UPS
                    questions and FedEx questions that you might have.

                <h2>Is Lojistic affiliated with UPS or FedEx?</h2>

                <p>
                    No. Our team is comprised of individuals that have former employment experience with UPS, FedEx,
                    DHL, and other freight carriers but Lojistic has no affiliation with any carrier and gets no benefit
                    from UPS for a UPS freight contract or from any other carrier for their freight contracts. This
                    enables us to suggest and provide unbiased shipping cost reduction solutions and advice when you are
                    looking for a good UPS contract and low UPS negotiated rates, as well as the best contracts and
                    rates for other carriers.

                <h2>Will your FedEx and UPS contract negotiation services adversely affect my carrier
                    relationships?</h2>

                <p>
                    We work with high volume shippers whose business model is predicated on the ability to ship product
                    around the world. Our UPS and FedEx contract negotiation services help improve your carrier
                    relationship by reminding your carrier that they must offer excellent service and price to retain
                    your business. It is important that UPS and FedEx be willing to offer your company excellent pricing
                    and service in each UPS contract and FedEx contract that they offer. Our freight contract
                    negotiations will reduce shipping costs and improve your carrier's level of service, and our parcel
                    audit service can help you develop the right UPS questions and proper FedEx questions to ask your
                    carrier.

                <h2>How do you calculate the UPS and FedEx cost savings that result from your contract negotiation
                    services?</h2>

                <p>
                    After Lojistic negotiates your new small parcel carrier agreement and you put it into effect, you
                    will begin to experience freight cost savings from our FedEx and UPS contract negotiations. By
                    comparing the net shipping costs under the new carrier contract versus what net shipping costs would
                    have been under the former carrier contract, we can easily determine the actual freight cost savings
                    that have resulted from our freight negotiation services. Our freight audit services are
                    particularly useful for determining the amount you have saved on your new FedEx contract or UPS
                    contract.

                <h2>How long does it take you to negotiate a new UPS and FedEx contract?</h2>

                <p>
                    Some of the most common freight management UPS questions and FedEx questions we receive concern the
                    length of time Lojistic takes for UPS and FedEx contract negotiation. Our freight contract
                    negotiation services are very systematic. Since we hold the carriers accountable to a defined
                    timeline, the entire process usually takes no longer than six to eight weeks to secure the best
                    FedEx or UPS negotiated rates. The burden of effort to produce timely results and significant
                    freight cost reduction is a top priortity when it comes to your new FedEx or UPS freight contract.
                    Lojistic can reduce shipping costs for your company and we will prove it.
