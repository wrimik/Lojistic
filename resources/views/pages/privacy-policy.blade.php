We may change the content or services found on our Web site, and consequently, our privacy statement at any time in the future.

            <h3>The Information We Gather</h3>
            <p>As a visitor to the public portion of the Company Web site, you do not have to submit any personal information in order to use the Web site and we do not monitor or collect any personally identifiable information from you in connection with your use of the public portions of our site. The site collects only personally identifiable information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors. Such information may consist of, but is not limited to, your name, current job title, company address, email address and telephone and fax numbers. We do not typically seek sensitive information (e.g., data relating to race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental health, or sexual orientation) from visitors. We will, where necessary, obtain visitors' explicit consent to collect and use such information.</p>

            <h3>Collection Devices</h3>
            <p>To ensure that our Web site is well managed and to facilitate improved navigation within the site, we may use Cookies (small text files stored in a user's browser) or Web Beacons (electronic images that allow the Web site to count visitors who have accessed a particular portion of our site and to access certain cookies) to collect aggregate data but such aggregate numbers will not identify you individually. We may use such devices to track information on our systems and identify categories of visitors by items such as IP address, domain, browser and pages visited, for systems administration, troubleshooting purposes and to report aggregate information. This information is reported to our Webmasters who use the information to analyze the number of visitors to different areas of the site and to make sure that our Web site is serving as a useful, effective information source.</p>

            <p>Neither our Cookies nor Web Beacons collect any personal information such as your name or email address. Further, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. However, under specific circumstances, visitors may be denied access to some parts of our site if their browsers are set to decline cookies.</p>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>If you register to use the password-protected portions of our site, we will ask you to provide us with certain information about yourself. Personal information is used only for limited purposes. For example, when you register with the Web site to gain access to our Careers section or request future communications about the Company, such as specific Company services or partner firm publications or marketing campaigns, we may use the information you submit to create a personal profile to customize our response to further requests or inquiries. In addition, the Webmasters may, where necessary, use your information for various site related tasks. We maintain personal information relating to our users of our Web site in a password-protected electronic file outside of our Web site or its servers and we limit access to such information to Company representatives who need to have such information to provide services to you. We emphasize to our Company representatives the confidential nature of customer information and the high level of importance we place on maintaining this confidentiality. We will only use such information about you to verify your identity and eligibility to receive certain products or services, to provide information to you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you to record your interest in products or services we offer and to respond to your requests for information. We will ensure that our marketing activities comply with applicable law, and implement procedures to obtain necessary consents before sending you emails containing information about Company service offerings. You may at any time request that we discontinue sending you such materials.</p>

            <h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
            <p>Although we may provide visitors' information to service providers that handle information on our behalf, we will typically not share the information with third parties or other Company entities for secondary or unrelated purposes unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection.</p>

            <p>Personal information may be transmitted to third parties for the purposes identified above. This may include transfer to countries without data protection rules similar to those in effect in a visitor's country of residence. By providing information to the Company through this Web site, you are consenting to such transfers. Where appropriate, personal information may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory or other government agencies; third parties where necessary or desirable to comply with legal or regulatory obligations; to protect our rights and interests and those of our business partners or requests for the purposes identified above.</p>

            <h3>Access to Information</h3>
            <p>We are committed to providing reasonable access to visitors who wish to review the personal information retained when they register with the Careers section of our Web site and to correct any inaccuracies it may contain. Visitors who would like to request a copy of their personal information should contact our Webmaster using the Contact Us link. In all cases we will treat requests to access information or change information in accordance with applicable legal requirements.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>Although we have tried to create a secure and reliable Web site for our users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via our Web site or by E-mail cannot be guaranteed. When disclosing any personal information, all users should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without user consent.

We have no responsibility or liability for the security of personal information transmitted via the Internet.
