                    contract?</h2>

                <p>
                    It is common knowledge that freight and small parcel carriers sell freight shipping contracts that
                    maximize carrier profit. Though your company may have a very qualified team of individuals managing
                    small parcel and freight contract negotiations, it is probable that a lot of money was left on the
                    negotiating table once the initial contract negotiating process was completed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    pricing experts at Lojistic use highly developed analytic software and industry knowledge to analyze
                    current FedEx contracts and UPS shipping contracts. Lojistic's carrier pricing analytics, freight
                    cost knowledge, carrier contract negotiation expertise, and shipping industry experience enable our
                    team to precisely identify areas of opportunity to improve existing small parcel and freight
                    contracts.

                    Expert negotiating abilities constitute a small part of Lojistic's toolset when reducing freight
                    costs via freight and small parcel contract negotiations. Many shippers and <a rel="nofollow" href="/parcel-freight-bill-audit">freight parcel audit</a>
                    companies try to compare FedEx and UPS freight contracts without using analytic software or the
                    inside knowledge of former high-level carrier employees. An effective analysis of any small parcel
                    carrier contract involves many variables. Lojistic has a proven track record of negotiating UPS
                    contracts and FedEx contracts and will guarantee to reduce freight costs.

                <p>
                    Although each freight and small parcel carrier contract usually has a defined term, they can be
                    revised at any time, and Lojistic can help optimize any revisions once contract negotiations begin.
                    There is no reason to continue overpaying for freight and small parcel shipping. Our carrier pricing
                    experts will perform an analysis of current shipping contracts to determine cost reduction
                    opportunities. Lojistic will help improve your carrier agreement to reflect market leading
                    incentives, bringing immediate and measurable freight cost savings to your business.

                <p>
                    Our contract negotiation solutions to reduce shipping costs do not require you to switch carriers or
                    change current operational procedures. Lojistic's freight and small parcel negotiation services will
                    present your company with market leading carrier pricing from both UPS and FedEx. It is entirely
                    your decision which carrier contract(s) you elect to utilize.

                <h2>I have a great relationship with my shipping carrier. Will hiring a third-party contract negotiator
                    jeopardize that relationship?</h2>

                <p>
                    One of the best ways to improve your carrier relationship is to remind them that they are not the
                    only small parcel carrier and that they need to work to retain your business which means superior
                    pricing and superior service. Our services help facilitate that "need to work" reminder, and in
                    doing so will also significantly reduce shipping costs. Lojistic's customers often receive a higher
                    level of service and attentiveness from their carrier after going through our carrier contract
                    negotiating process.

                    All UPS and FedEx customers have a confidentiality clause in their carrier agreement(s). Our freight
