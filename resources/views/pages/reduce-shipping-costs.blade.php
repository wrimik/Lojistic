                <h3>Benchmarking Abilities:</h3>
                <p>
                    After analyzing your company's shipping characteristics, we are able to
                    benchmark your current carrier pricing against the pricing we would expect
                    for your business. Therein, the savings opportunity will be identified.
                </p>

                    Our fees are based on a share of actual savings. We do not solicit projects in
                    which we are not 100% confident of our ability to reduce shipping costs. If our
                    analysis identifies a cost saving opportunity, implementation of our carrier
                    negotiation services will reduce shipping costs.
